        "text": "Owl20 is a browser extension that bridges Beyond20 dice roll data to Owlbear Rodeo iframes. It connects D&D Beyond character sheets to Owlbear Rodeo VTT by capturing roll data from the Beyond20 extension and sending it to the Owl20 Owlbear Extension. This free tool enables seamless integration between D&D Beyond and Owlbear Rodeo, allowing players to roll dice on D&D Beyond and have the results automatically appear in their virtual tabletop sessions. Perfect for D&D 5e games, D&D 5.5e campaigns, and any tabletop RPG using Owlbear Rodeo as their VTT platform."

Find 'Owl20' in that list and toggle the switch to ON. The extension must be enabled separately in each Owlbear Rodeo room - it doesn't automatically enable in all rooms.

Common issues include: Beyond20 not configured for Owlbear domains, OBR extension not enabled by DM, browser permissions blocked, or network connectivity problems.

Owl20 then takes that roll data from Beyond20 and bridges it to Owlbear Rodeo. Without Beyond20 installed and configured (specifically with Owlbear Rodeo domains added), Owl20 won't have any roll data to transmit.

The DM needs everything the players need, plus one more thing: the Owl20 OBR (Owlbear Rodeo) extension, which must be installed through Owlbear Rodeo's extension system and enabled in each room. Only the DM needs the OBR extension because it's what displays the rolls in the Owlbear Rodeo room for everyone to see.

The technical flow uses JavaScript event listeners, JSON data transmission, and iframe communication protocols.

First install Beyond20 and configure it for Owlbear Rodeo domains, then install Owl20 browser extension, and finally have your DM install the Owl20 OBR extension. This creates a complete bridge between D&D Beyond character sheets and your Owlbear Rodeo virtual tabletop, enabling automatic dice roll integration for D&D 5e and 5.5e games."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, Owl20 works with both D&D 5e and D&D 5.5e (2024 edition). Since Owl20 bridges dice roll data from D&D Beyond to Owlbear Rodeo, it works with any D&D edition that D&D Beyond supports. The extension captures roll data regardless of the specific D&D ruleset being used, making it compatible with traditional D&D 5e games, the new D&D 5.5e rules, and any future D&D Beyond updates."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Beyond20 is the original extension that connects D&D Beyond to various virtual tabletops like Roll20, Foundry VTT, and others. Owl20 is a specialized extension that specifically bridges Beyond20's data to Owlbear Rodeo. Think of Beyond20 as the foundation - it captures dice rolls from D&D Beyond. Owl20 builds on top of Beyond20 to extend that functionality to Owlbear Rodeo VTT. You need both extensions for the complete D&D Beyond to Owlbear Rodeo integration."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "If Owl20 isn't loading, start by checking the basics: make sure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) and that the extension is actually installed and enabled in your browser's extension settings. Try disabling and re-enabling the extension - sometimes extensions need a refresh to load properly. Check if your browser needs updates, as older versions might have compatibility issues. Review the extension permissions to ensure Owl20 has access to owlbear.rodeo domains. If you're still having issues, try restarting your browser completely. You can also check the browser console (F12) for any error messages that might indicate what's preventing the extension from loading."

It's available at no charge from all browser extension stores (Chrome Web Store, Edge Add-ons, and Firefox Add-ons).

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Owl20 requires minimal permissions for security and privacy. It needs scripting permission to inject the bridge code into Owlbear Rodeo pages, and host access specifically for owlbear.rodeo domains so it can communicate with the OBR extension. That's it - no access to your browsing history, no personal data collection, no tracking, and no access to other websites. Owl20 only runs on Owlbear Rodeo pages and only transmits dice roll data. This minimal permission model ensures your privacy while allowing the extension to function properly."

        "text": "To verify Owl20 is working, open your browser's Developer Tools (F12), go to the Console tab, and look for messages starting with 'Owl20:'. You should see messages like 'Owl20: Initializing data bridge', 'Owl20: Found iframe to owl20-owlbear', and 'Owl20: Sent roll data to Owl20 iframe via postMessage' when you make a dice roll.

All players' dice rolls will appear in the Owlbear Rodeo room when the DM has the Owl20 OBR extension enabled.

If you're having issues, try temporarily disabling ad blockers or script blockers on owlbear.rodeo and dndbeyond.com to see if that resolves the problem. You may need to whitelist these domains in your blocker settings. Owl20 uses standard web APIs (postMessage, CustomEvent) that shouldn't be blocked, but some privacy extensions are very restrictive."

            <p>Open Beyond20 settings, navigate to 'More Options' > 'Advanced Options', find 'List of custom domains to load Beyond20', and add 'https://www.owlbear.rodeo/*' to the list. Save your settings. This configuration allows Beyond20 to work with Owlbear Rodeo domains, enabling the dice roll integration. If you're having trouble finding the settings, look for "Advanced Options" or "Custom Domains" in the Beyond20 extension popup. This step is crucial for D&D Beyond dice rolls to appear in your Owlbear Rodeo VTT sessions.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The OBR extension is installed through Owlbear Rodeo's extension system. First, visit <a href="https://extensions.owlbear.rodeo/guide" target="_blank">https://extensions.owlbear.rodeo/guide</a> for detailed instructions on adding custom extensions. When prompted for the installation link, use: <code>https://owl20.FriendlyMimic.com/manifest.json</code>. This will add the Owl20 extension to your Owlbear Rodeo account. Important: Only the DM needs to install and enable the OBR extension - players don't need it. After installation, you'll need to enable it in each Owlbear Rodeo room where you want to use it.</p>

Refresh both D&D Beyond and Owlbear Rodeo tabs. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages. Ensure you're not using any ad blockers or script blockers that might interfere. Try closing and reopening the Owlbear tab. If issues persist, check the <a href="https://github.com/uberdragon/owl20/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issues page</a> for known problems or report the issue.</p>

            <p>Owl20 should work with most ad blockers, but aggressive script blockers or privacy extensions might interfere with its functionality. If you're having issues, try temporarily disabling ad blockers or script blockers on owlbear.rodeo and dndbeyond.com to see if that resolves the problem. You may need to whitelist these domains in your blocker settings. Owl20 uses standard web APIs (postMessage, CustomEvent) that shouldn't be blocked, but some privacy extensions are very restrictive.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Owl20 works with any recent version of Beyond20 that supports custom domains. As long as your Beyond20 extension is up to date and you've configured it to work with Owlbear Rodeo domains (by adding https://www.owlbear.rodeo/* to the custom domains list), it should work with Owl20. If you're having compatibility issues, make sure both Beyond20 and Owl20 are updated to their latest versions from their respective extension stores.</p>
